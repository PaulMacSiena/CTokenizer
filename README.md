# CTokenizer  
Paul Macfarlane  
This repository contains a C program that acts as a tokenizer for the language "Little C".  I developed this program for my Programming Languages class in the fall of 2019.  
  
Note: As with many of my public repositories on Github, this repository contains work from a private repository for a class at Siena College. If you would like access to the private repository with the original commit history and workflow, email me at pj16macf@siena.edu.
